Notes on PyCon UK 2019
======================

*Still to be finished. I need to:*

* *Finish writing up what I went to*
* *Finish witing up what I'd like to have gone to*
* *Put in links to slides, videos, etc.*
* *Add any other notes that seem appropriate*

`PyCon UK 2019`_ was held in Cardiff from Friday 13th to Tuesday 17th
September (that last day being sprints, which I did not attend this year).

This was the fourth year in Cardiff City Hall.

It was, as normal, a very good conference, and I think the committee has done
an amazing job producing it.

*Note:* Last year's conference felt a little weighted towards talks suitable
for beginners (mind you, that's the first year I've felt that). I think the
balance this year was a lot better.

The schedule_ was created using pretalx_, which is written by Sunday's keynote
speaker. The current version of pretalx doesn't support a phone-friendly
schedule, nor does it allow an attendee to highlight program items, but the
giggity_ app knows how to the output from pretalx, and turned out to be rather good.

*Note* Although Arm is no longer paying me as a Python programmer, they did
agree to fund me for my attendance at this conference, for which I am
grateful.

For some reason I'd never actually gotten round to visiting Brodies, the
iconic coffee shop near the City Hall (see their twitter feed at
https://twitter.com/BrodiesCoffee). They make *very* nice coffee, and are also
an excellent excuse to get out into the open air during the conference.

A useful thing to put on a title slide:

  If you can't see this PLEASE MOVE FORWARD

where the first words are the size of most of your text, and the last words
are big enough people will *definitely* be able to see them - so if they can't
read the beginning of the text, they just see "PLEASE MOVE FOWARD".

Board games and manual technology evening
=========================================

This year I played games, rather than trying to learn crochet.

The table I was at attempted to play The Mind (see
https://gameguythinks.com/the-mind-card-game/ and
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind). It was ... interesting.
But fun.

Then we played `In a Bind`_ (now marketed as Yogi_, "with waterproof cards"!)
and `Kitty Cataclysm`_, both by Bez_, and both of which I had taken along.

We didn't get to play `Before I kill you, Mister Spy...`_, but it was
leant out for someone else to play. Maybe next year.

Things I regret missing
-----------------------

Apparently the workshop Demystifying Neural Networks (Michal Grochmal) started
with maths, and then worked up to doing simple ML using just numpy. While I'm
not at all sure I'd have *understood* the maths, I agree that this sounds like
an interestingly different way to go at the issue, rather than just showing
how to use the available libraries.

Tuesday
=======

Given the choice of going home late Monday evening and taking Tuesday off to
recover, or doing a little tourism in the morning on Tuesday and getting home
at a more sensible time, I chose the latter. So in the morning I got up
slightly later, checked out of my hotel, and explored Cardiff Castle, which
I've seen from the outside, but never from the inside. I recommend it (it was
worth the Â£13.50 entry fee). I also got to see a bit more of Cardiff City
Centre, and to eat lunch at `The Stable`_, which I've been to twice before. I
had a very nice cider, and the Rad Kimchi pizza (pulled pork, roasted peppers,
kimchi, and edible flowers) which was both interesting and something I'd order
again.

CamPUG meetup
=============

The October meeting of the Cambridge Python User Group (CamPUG, Tuesday 1st
October, https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG/events/265064979/) will be partly a
retrospective on PyCon UK; those of us who attended can compare notes, and
those who did not can learn why they would like to have been there.
