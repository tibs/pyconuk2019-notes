Notes on PyCon UK 2019
======================

`PyCon UK 2019`_ was held in Cardiff from Friday 13th to Tuesday 17th
September (that last day being sprints, which I did not attend this year).

This was the fourth year in Cardiff City Hall.

The schedule_ was created using pretalx_, which is written by Sunday's keynote
speaker. The current version of pretalx doesn't support a phone-friendly
schedule, nor does it allow an attendee to highlight program items, but the
giggity_ app knows how to the output from pretalx, and turned out to be rather good.

*Note* Although Arm is no longer paying me as a Python programmer, they did
agree to fund me for my attendance at this conference, for which I am
grateful.

Tuesday
=======

Given the choice of going home late Monday evening and taking Tuesday off to
recover, or doing a little tourism in the morning on Tuesday and getting home
at a more sensible time, I chose the latter. So in the morning I got up
slightly later, checked out of my hotel, and explored Cardiff Castle, which
I've seen from the outside, but never from the inside. I recommend it (it was
worth the Â£13.50 entry fee). I also got to see a bit more of Cardiff City
Centre, and to eat lunch at `The Stable`_, which I've been to twice before. I
had a very nice cider, and the Rad Kimchi pizza (pulled pork, roasted peppers,
kimchi, and edible flowers) which was both interesting and something I'd order
again.

CamPUG meetup
=============
The October meeting of the Cambridge Python User Group (CamPUG,
https://www.meetup.com/CamPUG/events/265064979/) will be partly a
retrospective on PyCon UK, both for those of us who attended, and also for
those who did not.
