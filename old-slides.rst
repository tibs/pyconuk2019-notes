These date from 2016 and earlier.

So why go to a conference?
==========================

* Learning - of course
* Networking - making new friends
* Socialising - meeting old friends
* Validation - rebuilding enthusiasm
* Involvement - and paying back

Expanding on those:

* Learning: if a technical conference is any good you'll learn things from
  program items, and possibly also just from talking to people. Sometimes
  this can be an overview of a new field, sometimes a specific tool or
  library. I've always come away from PyConUK having learnt at least a
  couple of significant things. And this is one of the places where
  lightning talks can shine.

* Networking: it's a good place to make contacts within the Python
  community, and possibly withone one's own field as well. This also
  includes recruitment (the last several UK Python conferences have had
  specific recrtuitment sessions, and of course sponsorship acts as
  advertising)

* Socialising: it's nice to meet people you've got to know at previous
  conferences. For science fiction conventions, this is a principle element
  of the con, of course.

* Validation: there's a grand sense of "I'm doing the right thing" gained
  from going to a conference of people doing the same sort of thing
  (whether if be programming C, programming Python, or building embedded
  systems and doing device bring up). This can revitalise your involvement
  with what you're doing, and boost enthusiasm in general. Which is a Good
  Thing, and I think should not be underestimated.

* Involvement: it's good to get involved. This can be as simple as
  representing the company at a recruitment event, presenting a lightning
  talk (it can be constructed at the last minute!), or doing some session
  chairing (really, not so hard). Paying back to the conference and the
  community is a nice thing to do, and makes one feel good as well.

  And, of course, if you get involved people get to know you, and that's
  part of networking...

Some History
============

* **ACCU Apr 2002**: Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon
  - "including the Python UK Conference"
* *ACCU Apr 2003*
* **ACCU Apr 2004**: Oxford, with a 2 day Python track
* *ACCU Apr 2005*
* **ACCU Apr 2006**: Oxford, 2 day Python track
  - Guido van Rossum as keynote speaker

I know I was at the first of those, because I remember the venue and
specific items on the program. I'm fairly sure of the last, because of
Guido being a keynote speaker. I *think* the middle one is the right year,
I know I wasn't at 2003, and I don't think I got to 2005.

ACCU is/was relatively expensive, so I'd only go for the a couple of days.

I got partially funded for 2002.

History: PyConUK
================

The *actual* UK Python conferences were started by John Pinner and the West
Midlands Group.

* **PyConUK 2007** and **2008**: September, Birmingham Conservatoire
* **Python Unconference**: one day, September 2010, Birmingham
* **EuroPython 2009** and **2010**: June/July, Birmingham Conservatoire
* **Floss UK**: one day only, October 2010, Birmingham BMI
* **PyConUK 2011 to 2015** were in the TechnoCenter, Coventry
* **PyConUK 2016** moved to Cardiff

I got funded in 2010, and my boss and I gave talks - my first talk at a
PyConUK. https://metaljoe.wordpress.com/2010/07/24/europython-2010/ said:

  """To round off the day, I attended two talks by Richard Watts and Tony
  Ibbs of Kynesim who presented Muddle, their open source build system
  which looks very cool, and KBUS which is an elegant and lightweight
  messaging system implemented as a Linux kernel extension."""

In the EuroPython years, people still wanted a "something" in the latter
part of the year, hence the UnConference and the FlossUK event (which was
also an unconference - I requested an item on using Bacula, and in the way
of such things ended up "running" it!).  

2014 was John Pinner's last PyConUK.

I got funded in 2014, 2015 and 2016 by Velocix/ALU/Nokia
